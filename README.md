As to not piss off the developers, only the data files and such are included.

Simply drag and drop into a [ NEW ] copy of the base game you would like to install the template into.
This WILL overwrite everything, so I highly recommend you do NOT modify the base game, only copies.

A lot of this stuff is automated via ruby scripts so if anything is left behind/murderized by accident, let me know and I'll try to update it.

These come pre-packaged with mkxp-z to replace Game.exe. You can opt out of this by neglecting to add it to the folder.
The following are mkxp-z related files:
- System/ffi
- System/icon.png
- System/LICENSE
- System/preload.rb
- Game.exe
- mkxp.conf
- OpenAL32.dll
