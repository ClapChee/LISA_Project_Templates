As to not piss off the developers, only the data files and such are included.

Simply drag and drop into a [ NEW ] copy of the base game you would like to install the template into.
This WILL overwrite everything, so I highly recommend you do NOT modify the base game, only copies.

Maps for Painful are also re-organized to the best of my ability :)

These come pre-packaged with mkxp-z to replace Game.exe. You can opt out of this by neglecting to add it to the folder.
The following are mkxp-z related files:
- System/mkxp-z Pre-Load/mkxp_wrap.rb
- System/mkxp-z Pre-Load/ruby_classic_wrap.rb
- System/mkxp-z Pre-Load/win32_wrap.rb
- mkxp.json
- x64-msvcrt-ruby310.dll
- zlib1.dll
